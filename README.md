The goal of the project was to work again with **Local Storage**. The project is done on pure **JavaScript/Html/CSS**.

- you can add items 
- mark as completed
- delete items
- sort by category: all / selected / not selected
- not completed items are saved in the local storage and displayed when the page is refreshed
